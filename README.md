# hello-world
The first basic repository

//Hello Humans! 
This is a basic starting work of a previously failed programming student from Ukraine. I really want to succeed this time so I am always happy to hear any feedback regarding my work as well as anything that can bring me closer to becoming an expert in this field.

Good luck to y'all and happy to be here.
